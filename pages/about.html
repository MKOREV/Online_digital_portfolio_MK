    <h2>About me</h2>

    <img id="profile_pic" src="../images/profiel.jpg" alt="profile_picture_MK">

    <h1>Hey there!</h1>

    <p> I am a first-year Master student in the MADE (Metropolitan Analysis, Design, and Engineering) program. 
        My background is in Earth Sciences, but these days I am focused on tackling urban challenges. 
        I am interested in things like transport networks, smart cities, and using data to design better urban spaces. 
        I love working with spatial data and creating maps that tell stories about places and how we connect with them. 
        Outside of my studies, I enjoy wondering in (foreign) cities and nature as well as photographing and drawing. 
        I have always been fascinated by how visual design can communicate complex ideas, 
        and I am eager to learn more about using these skills to make urban challenges and solutions clear and engaging for different audiences.
